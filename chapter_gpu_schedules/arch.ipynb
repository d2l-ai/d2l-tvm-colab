    "High-end GPUs often provide a significantly better performance over high-end CPUs. Although the terminologies and programming paradigms are different between GPUs and CPUs, their architectures are similar to each other, with GPU having a wider SIMD width and more cores. In this section, we will brief review the GPU architecture in comparison to the CPU architecture presented in :numref:`ch_cpu_arch`.\n",

    "## Streaming Multiprocessor\n",
    "\n",
    "A streaming multiprocessor (SM) roughly equals a CPU core. The SM used by T4 is illustrated in :numref:`fig_gpu_sm`.\n",

    ":label:`fig_gpu_sm`\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen, an SM is partitioned into 4 processing blocks. In each block, there are 16 arithmetic units (AU) for processing float32 numbers, which are also called FP32 CUDA cores.\n",
    "In total, an SM has 64 FP32 AUs, which are able to execute 64 float32 operators (e.g. FMA) in each time. Besides the register files and the instruction loader/decoders, an SM has 8 tensor cores. Each tensor core is able to execute a $4\\times 4$ float16 (or int8/int4) matrix product in each time. So each one, we can call it FP16 AU, counts for $2\\times 4^3=128$ operators per clock. It is worth noting that in this chapter we won't use the tensor core. We will talk about utilizing it in the later chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that the SM only has an L1 cache, which is similar to CPU's L1 cache. However, we can use this storage as a shared memory for all threads running on the SM. We know that the cache is controlled by both hardware and operating system, while we can explicitly allocate and reclaim space on the shared memory, which gives us more flexibility to do performance optimization.\n",

    "Our Tesla T4 card contains 40 SMs with a 6MB L2 cache shared by all SMs. It also ships with 16GB high-bandwidth memory (GDDR6) that is connected to the processor. The overall architecture is illustrated in :numref:`fig_gpu_t4`.\n",
