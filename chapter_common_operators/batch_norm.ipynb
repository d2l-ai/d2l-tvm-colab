    "\n",
    "This section talks about how to use TVM to do batch normalization (`batch_norm`). Like pooling, `batch_norm` is also a common operator in CNN. D2L introduces this operator in [details](https://d2l.ai/chapter_convolutional-modern/batch-norm.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "From the calculation perspective, for a given value, `batch_norm` subtracts the $mean$ out of it, and then divide it with the square root of the $variance$, no difference than a regular normalization. It is call `batch_norm` because the mean and variance are attained from the batches of when performed the training. After that, `batch_norm` also applies an affine transformation to the value, i.e. multiplies it with a scale value $gamma$ followed by adding a shift value $beta$. $Gamma$ and $beta$ are attained from the gradient computation of training. Lastly, a small positive value $epsilon$ is added to prevent the divisor to be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of inference, both the mean and variance are determined, so the process of `batch_norm` is just a combination of several simple element-wise operations."

    "In practice, we are not going to perform `batch_norm` of one value. Instead, the `batch_norm` will be executed on the output of a convolution, namely, 3-D data in (channel, height, weight). Data in different channels have different values of $mean$, $variance$, $gamma$, and $beta$. The calculation can be expressed as the following formula.\n",
