For a more comprehensive survey, we recommend [this classic textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Architecture-Quantitative-John-Hennessy/dp/012383872X). We assume the readers knowing the basic system concepts such as clock rate (frequency), CPU cycle, and cache.\n",

The performance of various data types depends on the hardware. Let's first check the CPU model we are using."
